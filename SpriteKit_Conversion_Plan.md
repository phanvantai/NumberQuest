## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Starting Order

1. **Start with Step 1.1-1.3** - Set up foundation
2. **Move to Step 2.1-2.2** - Basic game scene
3. **Implement Step 2.3** - Connect game logic
4. **Add Step 2.4** - Visual effects
5. **Continue sequentially** - Each phase builds on previous

### Key Decision Points

- **Hybrid vs Full Conversion**: Keep some SwiftUI screens (Settings, Progress) vs full SpriteKit
- **Performance vs Visual Effects**: Balance eye candy with smooth performance
- **Complexity vs Timeline**: Prioritize core features vs advanced animations

### Success Metrics

- [ ] Maintains educational effectiveness
- [ ] Improves visual appeal and engagement
- [ ] Performs smoothly on target devices
- [ ] Preserves accessibility features
- [ ] Kids find it more fun and engaging

## Notes & Considerations

### Technical Challenges

- Text rendering and layout complexity
- Responsive design for multiple screen sizes
- Maintaining SwiftUI's declarative benefits
- State management between scenes

### Opportunities

- Much more engaging visual feedback
- Better animation performance
- More game-like feel
- Enhanced celebration effects
- Physics-based interactions

### Risk Mitigation

- Keep original SwiftUI code during development
- Test early and often on real devices
- Implement core features before advanced effects
- Maintain feature parity with current version
